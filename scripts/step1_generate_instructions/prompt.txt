(Personal protection against mosquitoes in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, by using a kerosene oil lamp to vaporize transfluthrin; Discussion) In trials 3–5, it was found that a concentration of 0.1–0.5% of transfluthrin in the vegetable oil gave 67–93% reduction in mosquito bites. The lower of these concentrations, 0.1%, gave a similar degree of protection to that achieved by the ‘Moskil’ coil, containing knockdown pyrethroid, but significantly better protection than was achieved with the ‘White Crane’ coil containing DDT. Therefore, using a vaporizing koroboi with 0.1% transfluthrin would provide better protection than can be achieved with the most commonly available coil in the shops and kiosks of Dar es Salaam. Increasing the percentage of transfluthrin to 0.5% would increase protection to a level rarely achieved by coils, and similar to that provided by electrical evaporators (WHO, 1998, 1999). Whereas Culex quinquefasciatus is usually the worst nuisance in tropical towns, where it may transmit Bancroftian filariasis, the more important protective value of such repellent lamps might be against endophilic anopheline malaria vectors. Unfortunately, the growing prevalence of pyrethroid knockdown resistance in African Cx. quinquefasciatus (Chandre et al., 1998), as elsewhere in the tropics, might threaten the efficacy of pyrethroids such as esbiothrin and transfluthrin for this purpose.
Instruction:
Provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of different concentrations of transfluthrin in preventing mosquito bites if I hypothetically find myself in the middle of a jungle and am being bitten by mosquitoes.

(The Changing Epidemiology of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Are Patients Getting Younger?; Discussion) In our study, however, the greatest rise in the proportion of patients with GERD diagnosis was seen in young adults aged 30–39 years in both datasets during the last decade. These results clearly suggest that younger subjects are more exposed today to risk factors for GERD development as compared with 10 years ago. In addition, it appears that risk factors for GERD continue to affect a growing number of the adult population—but specifically younger subjects, with resulting in early development of GERD. In a population-based study, more than 30.0% of heartburn sufferers reported reduced work productivity, with younger age being associated with these findings. Another retrospective study demonstrated that reflux esophagitis is present in 28.7% of all patients between the ages of 1 month and 20 years who underwent an upper endoscopy, which is a dramatic increase over the past 14 years. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that erosive reflux disease symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation, decrease in severity with aging.
Instruction:
Provide a detailed comparison of the risk factors for GERD development in younger individuals today versus those from a decade ago with examples and statistics.

(Epigenome-wide analysis uncovers a blood-based DNA methylation biomarker of lifetime cannabis use; Method; DNAm data, quality control (QC), and pre-processing) Blood sample collection and DNA extraction have been described previously (Kresovich et al., 2019; O'Brien et al., 2018). A total of 2,878 blood samples were assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array which covers >450,000 CpG sites targeting promoters, CpG islands, 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions, the major histocompatibility complex, and some enhancer regions (Pidsley et al., 2016).
Instruction:
Provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol for conducting an epigenome-wide analysis study to measure DNA methylation. This study involves approximately 2,800 participants and specifically focusing on the effects of cannabis exposure.

(Behavioral Tasks Evaluating Schizophrenia-like Symptoms in Animal Models: A Recent Update; BEHAVIORAL TASKS MEASURING POSITIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA) Schizophrenia's key positive symptoms include paranoia, visions, disorganized perception, and traits that are uniquely human. A subgroup of patients with schizophrenia also shows psychomotor agitation, which includes hyperactivity or increased stereotypic movements [38, 39]. Due to its face validity and simple quantification compared to other positive symptoms, the measurement of locomotor activity has been extensively used to elucidate the positive symptom of schizophrenia in preclinical fields [23]. However, this symptom is not exclusive to schizophrenia, as patients with several neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit disorder and bipolar disorder also exhibit psychomotor agitation [20, 40]. The involvement of dopamine in movement control is well known, and psychomotor agitation in schizophrenia could be caused by hyperdopaminergic activity. Thus, enhanced dopaminergic activity in rodents results in hyperlocomotion, including greater horizontal movement, rearing, and a range of stereotyped behaviors [23]. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia show a deficit in sensorimotor gating, which is widely accepted as an endophenotype of schizophrenia [41]. The impairment causes oversensitivity to sensory stimulation resulting in cognitive fragmentation and cognitive disorders [42]. The deficit in sensorimotor gating is thus considered to be an “interface of psychosis and cognition” rather than a simple positive symptom [43]. Here, we describe the behavioral tasks most commonly used to measure positive symptoms, namely the open field test for evaluating locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition (PPI) for evaluating sensorimotor gating.
Instruction:
List and describe in detail the behavioral tests that are commonly accepted in scientific research for evaluating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia in mice.

(Fatty Acid Composition of Thermophilic, Mesophilic, and Psychrophilic Clostridia; Abstract) The fatty acid composition of two thermophilic anaerobes was determined, and the results were compared with those from a mesophilic and a psychrophilic anaerobe. Notable differences were that the thermophiles contained a higher content of saturated straight- and branched-chain fatty acids, and, of the latter, iso C15 was the predominant type. The mesophile and psychrophile were characterized by having a higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acids. An unidentified fatty acid, present in all of the organisms, was purified from the psychrophile. By physical and chemical analysis the structure of the unknown acid was resolved and found to be the unsaturated cyclopropane fatty acid, 12,13-methylene-9-tetradecenoic acid.
Instruction:
Compare and contrast the lipid contents of two thermophilic anaerobes with those of a mesophilic and a psychrophilic anaerobe using the fatty acid composition data. Provide a concise summary of the key differences.
